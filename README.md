# From First Principles: K-Means Clustering on Handwritten Digits

This project implements the k-means clustering algorithm from scratch and applies it to:
- A simple 2D dataset (`XData`)
- The MNIST handwritten digits dataset

ðŸ“Š Key Topics:
- Random vs. k++ initialization
- Coherence as a clustering metric
- Elbow method for choosing `k`
- Application to high-dimensional data (MNIST)

ðŸ“‚ Contents:
- `k_means_first_principles.pdf` â€” full implementation in Python
- `k_means_first_principles.pdf` â€” project report
  
âš¡ Highlights:
- k++ initialization consistently yields lower coherence compared to random initialization
- On MNIST, k-means achieved 52.5% accuracy
- Demonstrates both the strengths and limitations of unsupervised learning
